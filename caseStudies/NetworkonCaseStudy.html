              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
                NetworkON is one of my first production grade projects and also the one I am most proud of. This
                project has challenged me in so many regards that even today I go back to it to figure out
                possible solutions to many of my problems. This project included so many algorithms and use cases
                that handling all of them and making sure that all work in harmony was the real highlight.
              </p>
              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
                The first and foremost requirement of any delivery management software is it's route optimization
                capabilities. I am proud to say that I was the lead in the development of the route optimization solution.
                This solution grew as the project scaled, from including automated route optimization to managing vehicle
                capacities, I handled it all. Managing capacities was particularly tricky as it was not just restricted to
                route optimization but in general as well, and the capacities could not be assumed as consumed until the
                optimized route was confirmed by the admin.
              </p>
              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
                Then there was the custom notifications, one of the first features I worked on for this project. My task
                was to send notifications to a clients customers once an action was triggered. These notifications could
                be customized by the admin from the dashboard and would then be filled in with the customer specific details
                once the trigger was executed. All of this being handled at the backend.
              </p>
              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
                Last but not the least, the earning and pricing feature for the platform. Created for the case of demand based
                deliveries scenario, where earning was to be calculated for the Agent delivering and pricing was what the customer
                is going to be charged. This was again something that the Admin could customize based on their requirements
                and would have to be calculated at run time whenever an order was placed. Obviously this required speed and
                precision, both of which I was able to delivery successfully by dividing the code in smaller functions and
                allowing for the code to compute different things at once and combing it all in the end.
